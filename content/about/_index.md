I'm a Software Engineer, passionate about developing efficient and reliable test automation solutions. As a test lead, I focus on enhancing software quality through advanced testing strategies and automation frameworks. My background in software engineering drives me to tackle complex challenges and continuously expand my knowledge by exploring new technologies.

Beyond work, I’m committed to self-improvement. I blog to store important information, hold myself accountable, and ensure I stay on top of learning new things. I love experimenting with the latest tech trends. However, when I’m not at my computer, you can find me either in the gym working out or at home trying out a new recipe I found on YouTube.
